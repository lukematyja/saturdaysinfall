    @thletics values your protection and data security!
    We will do everything in our power to keep your information and passwords secure.
    It is highly recommended that you create strong passwords consisting of at least
    20 random characters. You can use <a href="https://www.lastpass.com/password-generator" target="_blank">LastPass</a>
    to generate (and even save) your passwords. <br><br>

    After you sign up, your password will be encrypted.
    Nobody will be able to see your actual password, so if you forget it,
    you will need to follow the password reset process.
    You will be emailed a reset token which you can use to submit a new password. <br>
