    My Underdog friends, <br><br>

    The season is nearing completion, but our pool has run its course.
    I want to thank you all for taking part in the fun - hopefully you enjoyed it! <br><br>

    I'm hoping to get some web developer help in the offseason and kick-off a more automated version of this pool for next year.
    While it was a lot of fun to watch the games each Saturday -
    manually entering all the data and maintaining the Google Forms got a bit exhausting. <br><br>

    For next year (assuming the web development happens),
    I'll be making at least a few tweaks to the rules/pool layout (See bottom of email) -
    if you have any ideas or suggestions, send an email back and I'll consider them!
    Anyone that participated this year will be on the initial email list next year. <br><br>

    Lastly, the moment you've all been waiting for...drumroll....
    The winner of the Inaugural UnderDog Special Pool is Andy Heiser with 333 Points.
    Andy killed it this year. To be honest, it wasn't even close.
    Andy scored 56.5 points more than second place and he was a lock to win going into the bowl week.
    Fantastic job Andy! Your trophy is in the mail and I will email you when the PayPal goes through! <br><br>

    Your second place winner was Rachel Handfinger with 276.5 Points!
    Rachel was in first place for much of the season but toward the end Andy pulled away.
    Rachel you get your money back - Congrats! <br><br>

    Other superlatives are as follows -
    Highest scoring week goes to Beau Ordemann for scoring 65 points in week 11.
    Eric Larson and Nate Jones get the YOLO award for the highest point value scored in one pick with 53 points for doubling up on Kentucky's victory over Louisville in week 13.
    Ms. Consistent award to Rachel Handfinger for scoring points every single week.
    That's 15 weeks in a row. Mike Ziegler for best comeback attempt after taking over Mike Petrella's account
    (which was in dead last with 2 points through 6 weeks) and scoring 170.5 pts between weeks 7 and 13, rising to a finishing position of 15th. <br><br>

    Lastly, recognition to the following people for achieving UNDERDOG STATUS:<br>
    300 Point Club (Great Dane Status): Andy Heiser<br>
    200 Point Club (Mastiff Status): Rachel Handfinger, Maggie Ordemann, Moira Groh, Tyler Glass, Beau Ordemann, Sean Sites, John Matyja & Chris Burke. <br><br>

    Tweaks for next year: <br>
    - Payout additional places <br>
    - Portion of Pool $ to highest scorer each week <br>
    - Allow for picks to be entered on a rolling basis, and edited up until kick-off (assuming we can code it this way) <br>
    - Real-time scoreboard/standings <br><br>

    Until next year! <br>
    Your loyal underdog commissioner Luke, Signing off
